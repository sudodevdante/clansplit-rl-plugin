# ClanSplit RuneLite Plugin

**Automatically track and split PvP loot with your clan in real-time.**

ClanSplit is a web-based loot splitting tool designed for Old School RuneScape PvP clans. This official RuneLite plugin automatically detects when you open PvP Loot Keys and sends the values to your active ClanSplit session, making loot distribution fast, fair, and transparent.

## üéØ What is ClanSplit?

ClanSplit ([app.clansplit.com](https://app.clansplit.com)) is a web application that helps PvP clans:
- **Track loot** from all clan members in real-time
- **Calculate fair splits** with configurable key reduction and clan tax
- **Manage sessions** with session leaders and late joiners
- **Checkout seamlessly** with automatic profit/debt calculations

The RuneLite plugin eliminates manual entry by automatically sending your loot key values to your session.

## üîß How It Works

### Loot Detection
The plugin listens for specific chat messages that indicate you've opened a loot key:

**Clan Broadcast Messages:**
```
[Clan] YourName has opened a loot key worth 187,036 coins!
```

**Direct Game Messages:**
```
You receive a PvP loot key worth 187,036 coins.
You open a loot key worth 187,036 coins.
```

### Data Sent to ClanSplit
When a loot key is detected, the plugin sends:
- **Your OSRS character name**
- **Loot key value** (in coins)
- **Session ID** (to know which session to update)
- **Unique nonce** (prevents duplicate entries)
- **Timestamp** (for accurate tracking)

### Security
- All data is sent over **HTTPS** (encrypted)
- **Token authentication** ensures only you can add keys to your session
- Tokens can be **rotated at any time** from your account settings
- The plugin **never** tracks other players' loot keys

---

## üîí Privacy & Security

### What the Plugin Tracks
‚úÖ **YOUR loot keys only** - detected from your own chat messages  
‚úÖ **Your OSRS character name** - to link you to your session  
‚úÖ **Your session ID** - to know where to send the data

### What the Plugin Does NOT Track
‚ùå Other players' loot keys  
‚ùå Your inventory or bank  
‚ùå Your location or activities  
‚ùå Any personal information

### Data Usage
- Data is only sent when **you explicitly configure** the Session ID and Token
- You can **disable the plugin** at any time
- You can **rotate your token** if it's compromised
- You can **delete your account** and all associated data from the webapp

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Plugin Not Sending Keys
1. **Check the configuration**: Ensure Enable is ON, Session ID and Token are correctly entered
2. **Verify the session**: Make sure the session is still active on the webapp
3. **Check your token**: Try rotating your token and updating it in the plugin config
4. **Restart the plugin**: Toggle it off and on in the config

### Keys Not Appearing in Webapp
1. **Hard refresh the webapp**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (or `Cmd+Shift+R` on Mac)
2. **Check the session ID**: Make sure you're viewing the correct session
3. **Verify SSE connection**: The webapp uses Server-Sent Events for real-time updates

### Token Issues
- If you've rotated your token, update it in the plugin configuration immediately
- Old tokens are invalidated when you generate a new one
- Keep your token private - don't share it with anyone
